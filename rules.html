                        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
                        team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                        this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey

                                adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</P>

                                the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
                                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
                                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                                field may be required to play all their games away.</P>
